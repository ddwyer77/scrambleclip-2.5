# Input Videos Directory

Place your source MP4 or MOV video files in this directory. These will be used by Scramble Clip 2 to generate randomized video clips.

## Supported Formats
- MP4 (.mp4)
- QuickTime (.mov)

The application will automatically detect and use these video files when generating output clips.

For best results:
1. Include at least 4 different videos
2. Videos should be of reasonable quality (720p or higher recommended)
3. Landscape, portrait, or square videos are all acceptable - they will be padded to 9:16 aspect ratio
