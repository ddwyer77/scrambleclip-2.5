Place your source video files (MP4 or MOV format) in this directory.
The application will randomly select clips from these videos to create your output videos.

For best results:
1. Include at least 4 different videos
2. Videos should be of reasonable quality (720p or higher recommended)
3. Landscape, portrait, or square videos are all acceptable - they will be padded to 9:16 aspect ratio
